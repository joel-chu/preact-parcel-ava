## Why preact?

First, Its faster, it's smaller therefore it's better!

Second, I don't support company that's sole purpose is generate fake news to capture eyeballs, steal your personal information to sell for money. And on top of that, waving around the flag of defending freedom then as-a-matter-of-fact purposely support mindless riot around the world that destroy lives!
